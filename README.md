# Machine-learning-_Prediction-MBA-Admission-

The project "Predicting MBA Admission Success Based on Academic and Demographic Factors" aims to leverage a dataset containing key academic and personal information to predict success in MBA admissions. The dataset includes data points such as academic performance (scores from 10th, 12th, undergraduate, and MBA programs), demographic details (age, gender, marital status, and place of residence), and career-related factors (previous degree, job role, skills, and MBA specialization). By analyzing these variables, the project seeks to develop predictive models that could assist in determining the likelihood of admission success, potential career progression, or job placement post-MBA, offering valuable insights for candidates, educational institutions, and recruiters.
